### Joining as a contributor

> [!NOTE]
> This is for individuals seeking to register themselves as a contributor under governance.

Create a new TOML file in `contributors/` with your GitHub username as the filename, e.g. `your-github-username.toml`:

```toml
full-name = "Your Name"
github-username = "your-github-username"
slack-member-id = "U07FPJKFB5E"
```

All of these fields are required.

To find your `slack-member-id`, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your profile
2. Click the three dots
3. Select "Copy member ID"

This value should begin with a `U`.

> [!WARNING]
> Pull requests adding a new contributor must be submitted by the contributor themselves. This self-nomination approach promotes ownership, helps maintain the integrity of our contributor list, and encourages active participation with our governance process and the organization. PRs in violation will be automatically rejected.
